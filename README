warp-sabre is a suite of programs to generate calibrated slippy map tiles
from a variety of old maps, and the main program to generate the in-house
mapping at SABRE Maps (https://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/maps).

It is derived off a suite of OpenStreetMap tools called warp-gbos (that
was used to produce the New Popular and Seventh Series tiles there,
that pre-date SABRE Maps) with some extra bells and whistles to handle
archaic things such as the MOT maps. Support is currently being added
to handle Michelin maps of Western Europe.

==Features==

The suite currently supports the following:

    Ordnance Survey GB National Grid
    WGS84 Lat/Lon
    Cassini (as used on England and Wales MoT maps)
    Scottish Bonne (as used on Scottish MoT maps)
    Irish Bonne (used on old Irish maps)
    Irish Grid (OSI65) as used on OSI and OSNI mapping
    Michelin datum with Plessi ellipsoid (used for Michelin maps of Europe)
    French Bonne (used on Michelin maps)

It does not currently support (but will in the future):

    Ordnance Survey GB National Yard Grid (but conversion can be done manually)
    OSGB36 Lat/Lon

==Programs==

warp-sabre - combines a map image and calibration file to create a rectified
map image and a Keyhole Markup Language (KML) file that can be loaded into
Google Maps or Google Earth to check the accuracy of the calibration file

gentiles - takes a group of rectified map images, with KML files, and creates
all the tiles (may take hours, sometimes days, to run)

cleartiles - takes a group of rectified map images, with KML files, and
deletes all the associated tiles. This is important when doing small,
incremental updates to a set of tiles with multiple maps; running cleartiles
before gentiles makes sure that all tiles that need to be updated
(particularly those that span the edge of maps) are re-created, but others
are left alone.

==Calibration file format==

Calibration files are a series of comma separated values. Each co-ordinate is
on one line. They look slightly different depending on whether you are using
lat / lon or grid references.

===Latitude / longitude===

A lat / lon file looks something like this:
p,51.8,-0.5,300,200
p,51.8,-0.1,1200,200
p,51.7,-0.5,300,900
p,51.7,-0.1,1200,200

The "p" tells the calibrator this is a lat / lon co-ordinate. The next
values are the latitude and longitude of the point, followed by the x and y
co-ordinate the point is on the map image.

===Grid reference===

A grid reference file looks something like this:
os,400000:250000,300,200
os,500000:250000,1200,200
os,400000:150000,300,900
os,500000:150000,1200,200

The "os" tells the calibrator this is a grid reference co-ordinate. The next
values are the metres east and metres north of the grid reference, followed by
the x and y co-ordinate the point is on the map image. (Note, the grid
reference values are separated by a colon, not a comma; this is because grid
references can also be specified using the two letters + number format, which
is not generally used by SABRE Maps).

In both of the examples, the calibration defines the four corners of a
map - top left, top right, bottom left and bottom right. The four corner
co-ordinates are the most important ones to include in a calibration file,
otherwise the map has no idea where it is supposed to be displayed in the
world - at all.
