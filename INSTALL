The following libraries are required:
* Boost - for odds and ends (mainly used for parsing command line arguments)
* ImageMagick - for loading and saving images
* LibXML - for parsing Google Earth KML files
* Newmat - for the matrix transformations used when rectifying map images
* Xmorph - does the job of physically moving pixels in an image when
           rectifying it

==Linux==
For Debian Linux, you should be able to run :
sudo apt-get install libboost-dev libmorph-dev libmagickwand-dev g++ libxml-dev libnewmat10-dev

To build, type:
./bootstrap
./configure
make
sudo make install

==macOS==
For macOS using homebrew, a little more work is required
brew install llvm imagemagick boost xquartz
	llvm is required because the stock macOS clang does not support
	-fopenmp which is required by the ImageMagick C++ API
Newmat and Xmorph must be installed manually into the homebrew directories
eg: /usr/local/lib for X86_64, /opt/homebrew/lib for arm64

Before calling configure, set the following environemnt variables to point
to homebrew. For arm64 macOS, these are:
CXX=/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/clang++
CXXFLAGS=-I/opt/homebrew/include
LDFLAGS=-L/opt/homebrew/lib -L/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/lib -L/opt/homebrew/opt/libomp/lib
BOOST_ROOT=/opt/homebrew/include
MAGICKWAND_CFLAGS=`Magick++-config --cppflags`
MAGICKWAND_LIBS=`Magick++-config --libs`
