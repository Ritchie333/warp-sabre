The following libraries are required:
* Boost - for odds and ends (mainly used for parsing command line arguments)
* ImageMagick - for loading and saving images
* LibXML - for parsing Google Earth KML files
* Newmat - for the matrix transformations used when rectifying map images
* Xmorph - does the job of physically moving pixels in an image when
           rectifying it

==Linux==
For Debian Linux, you should be able to run :
sudo apt-get install libboost-dev libmorph-dev libmagickwand-dev g++ libxml-dev libnewmat10-dev

To build, type:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install

==macOS==
For macOS using homebrew:
brew install magick++ boost xquartz
Newmat and Xmorph must be installed manually into the homebrew directories
eg: /usr/local/lib for X86_64, /opt/homebrew/lib for arm64

To build, type:
mkdir build
cd build

(for x64) cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES=/usr/local/include -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_LIBRARIES=-L/usr/local/lib
(for arm64) cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES=/opt/homebrew/include -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_LIBRARIES=-L/opt/homebrew/lib

make
sudo make install
