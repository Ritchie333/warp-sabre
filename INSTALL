The following libraries are required:
* Boost - for odds and ends (mainly used for parsing command line arguments)
* ImageMagick - for loading and saving images
* LibXML - for parsing Google Earth KML files
* Newmat - for the matrix transformations used when rectifying map images
* Xmorph - does the job of physically moving pixels in an image when
           rectifying it

For Debian Linux, you should be able to run :
sudo apt-get install libboost-dev libmorph-dev libmagickwand-dev g++ libxml-dev libnewmat10-dev

To build, type:
./bootstrap
./configure
make
sudo make install
